## What it is

A pomodoro clock project from [freecodecamp's frontend certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock). The clock contains clickable elements that allow the user to change the amount of time a working session and break session will last. You can play, pause and reset the timer. When the timer concludes a notification noise sounds off and the next break or sessions begins.
